### EgoViT: Pyramid Video Transformer for Egocentric Action Recognition
<span id="EgoViT"></span>
***Summary:***  Egocentric videos often have a large amount of background scene transition, 
  
  
***High light:*** Use PCA shows that there are redundant information in in the neighboring frame vectors. Then propose pyramid architecture to resolved this issue. Dynamic merging mechanism to replace average pooling.
